# setting up to use boost on atlas
# Ruth has provided jsoncpp for us (used for the calibration interface)
# and Tobey has provided boost (used for a variety of things - logging, signals, etc)

# NOTE: (07-21-2017) Tobey re-compiled a more recent version of jsoncpp so as
# to avoid a problem with a deprecated function (getFormattedErrorMessages()).
# So now we've changed this file to look in Tobey's home for the jsoncpp libs.
# One funky thing with the jsoncpp build is that it puts the libraries in 
# an architecture and compiler dependant sub-directory. So we have to add that to the 
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH, as the linker does not seem smart enough to look the extra 
# level of depth...
