Note: for future reference, the x and y offsets to create
this set of files from the SNAP data are x:228, y:635

Discovered that in the past, we had been using rsds values for 
vapor_press! When I went to create new files with
the bug fixed, I realized that I only had vapor pressure numbers
thru 2039. Maybe we had been using rsds simply as an easy way
to fill out the arrays for vapor pressure. The values and patterns
are not terribly different between the two.

However to remedy the issue, here were my steps:
 
 - Download the remainder of the vapor pressure data from SNAP
 - Run the new (parallel) version of the create_region_input.py
   script. This is a little strange, as I haven't merged that 
   branch yet, but it is so much faster, (~10min to create the
   whole dataset) that I wanted to use it. I ended up doing a
   smaller test with the old serial version, and it provided the
   same results.

        $ ./create_region_input.py --tifs ../../snap-data/ --tag SewardPen --years -1 --yoff 635 --xoff 228 --xsize 10 --ysize 10 --which all

 - Then poke around at the files a bit to make sure that
   only what I expect was changed. 

 - Use IPython to really check that the climate data only changed
   for the vapo_press variable:

        In [16]: %paste
        import netCDF4 as nc
        old_hist = nc.Dataset("../DATA/SewardPen_10x10/historic-climate.nc", 'r')
        new_hist = nc.Dataset("some-dvmdostem-inputs/SewardPen_10x10/historic-climate.nc", 'r')

        delta_tair = old_hist.variables['tair'][:,0,0] - new_hist.variables['tair'][:,0,0]
        delta_precip = old_hist.variables['precip'][:,0,0] - new_hist.variables['precip'][:,0,0]
        delta_nirr = old_hist.variables['nirr'][:,0,0] - new_hist.variables['nirr'][:,0,0]
        delta_vapor_press = old_hist.variables['vapor_press'][:,0,0] - new_hist.variables['vapor_press'][:,0,0]

        print delta_tair.max(), delta_tair.min()
        print delta_precip.max(), delta_precip.min()
        print delta_nirr.max(), delta_nirr.min()
        print delta_vapor_press.max(), delta_vapor_press.min()

        ## -- End pasted text --
        0.0 0.0
        0.0 0.0
        0.0 0.0
        6.51266 -5.32817

 - This looks good - only the vapor_press variable has changed.
 - Copy the new climate files into place, write this file and commit.
