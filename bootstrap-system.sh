# Note: If gdb is not installed, then QT Creator will complain about "Unable

#       Also it may be necessary to install xterm. For some reason Colin and

# Install Doxygen and Graphviz
# Note: There is a problem with some older versions of Doxygen (specifically
#       1.8.6, maybe others). The problem is that some classes and functions
#       don't have complete "Referenced by" lists and some of the links for
#       "Definition at line ..." links don't show up. This doesn't seem to be
#       the case with more recent versions of Doxygen, so we install the
#       "rawhide" repo and install Doxygen from there...
yum install -y fedora-release-rawhide

# The man page conflicts between vim and vim-minimal. Removing vim-minimal
# takes sudo with it, crippling later attempts at inline provisioning. So we
# make sure to reinstall sudo.
